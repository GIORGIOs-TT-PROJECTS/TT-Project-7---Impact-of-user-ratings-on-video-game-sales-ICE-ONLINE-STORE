# IMPACT OF THE USER RATINGS ON VIDEO GAME SALES - ICE ONLINE STORE


## PROJECT OVERVIEW

You work for the Ice online store that sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation) and historical data on game sales are all available in open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not. This will allow you to spot promising projects and plan advertising campaigns.

In front of you is data going back to 2016. Let's imagine it's December 2016 and you're planning a campaign for 2017.

The important thing is to gain experience working with data. It doesn't really matter if you're forecasting 2017 sales based on 2016 data or 2027 sales based on 2026 data.

The dataset contains a "rating" column that stores the ESRB rating for each game. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating of either Teen or Adult.

## STEPS:

### STEP 1: IMPORTING LIBRARIES

### STEP 2: LOADING DATA

### STEP 3: DATA EXPLORATION

### STEP 4: DATA PREPROCESSING

### STEP 5: DATA ANALYSIS

### STEP 6: PLATFORM PROFILES BY REGION ANALYSIS

### STEP 7: HYPOTHESIS TESTS

## CONCLUSION

Correlations between user and critic ratings:

- There is no relationship between user reviews and total sales of video games, so these reviews do not influence the customer when making a purchase. On the contrary, there seems to be a small relationship between professional reviews and sales, although it is a low correlation in some cases, which determines the sales performance of video games.

Popular Platforms:

- The platforms that are currently growing/leading sales are `PS4`, `Xbox One` and `Nintendo 3DS`.

Genres:

- The most popular genres are `action` and `shoters` in `NA` and `EU`.
- The `Role-Playing` genre is the most popular in the `JP` region.

ESRB Ratings

- ESRB ratings influenced regional sales.
- Sales by ESRB ratings were the same in NA and EU, but different in JP.

Hypothesis

- We reject the null hypothesis that average user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms are equivalent.
- We cannot reject the null hypothesis that the average user ratings of the Action and Sports genres are equivalent.
